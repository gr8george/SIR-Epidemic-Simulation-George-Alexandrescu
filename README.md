# SIR Epidemic Simulation (EBM vs ABM)

University project comparing two approaches for modeling epidemics:
- Equation-Based Modeling (EBM) using the Euler Method
- Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) with agents moving in 2D space (stochastic)

## Project status
This is an unfinished version of my individual work.

## Files
- `src/ebm_sir.py` – Euler method solver for SIR model
- `src/abm_sir.py` – Agent-based SIR simulation
- `src/main.py` – Runs both models and plots results

## Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
